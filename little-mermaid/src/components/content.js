                Long ago, deep beneath the ocean waves, the Sea King lived with his many daughters. His youngest, the Little Mermaid, was fascinated by the 
                human world. She also loved to sing, enchanting the fish and crustaceans around her with her unique voice. 
                On her fifteenth birthday, she was finally allowed to rise to the surface, where she saw a handsome prince aboard a ship. 
                She instantly fell in love, but a violent storm struck, sending the prince overboard. 
                The mermaid rushed to save him from drowning, leaving him on the shore before he regained full consciousness.

                Unlike humans, mermaids did not have eternal souls. After reaching 300 years, they simply turned into seafoam. 
                Longing for both the prince and an eternal soul, the mermaid sought out the Sea Witch. 
                In exchange for her beautiful singing voice, she was given human legs, though walking would feel like stepping on hundreds 
                of knives. The Sea Witch also warned her that the only way to keep her new life and gain a soul was to marry the prince. 
                If she failed, she would die and turn into seafoam.

                Determined, the mermaid endured the pain and went to the surface on her new pair of legs. She formed a close bond with the prince,
                despite being unable to speak to him. However, the prince did not fall in love with her. He eventually ended up in an 
                arranged marriage to the princess from a neighboring kingdom. Heartbroken, the mermaid worried her time was up at sunrise. 
                In a last ditch effort to fix everything, her sisters swam up to the surface bearing a dagger. If the mermaid were to 
                stab the prince with it and kill him, her life would return to normal. Despite this solution existing, the mermaid couldn't bring herself to do it. 
                She threw the dagger and herself back into the water. While she ultimately dissolved into seafoam, the mermaid did not die. 
                Instead, she became a daughter of the air, earning the chance to gain a soul through her selflessness.
